            <p class="lead">United States data from 1970s to 2022 which compares educational attainment with factors such
                as race and gender, exploring the impact on employment rates and wages. </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container" id="bsr-wrapper">
        <h1>Project Topic Choice</h1>
        <p>In our project, we chose to explore the correlation between educational attainment and the resulting effect on wages and employment rates. We pulled from data sources which included those factors, and additonally included variables such as race and gender.</p>
  <div class='my-5'></div>
        <h3>Exploration Questions</h3>
        <p>
            <br>1. What is the general trend in wages and employment rates from the 1970s to present day? </br>
            <br>2. How do different educational attainment levels effect wages and employment rates, and how does has this change overtime?</br>
            <br>3. How do factors such as race and gender play into the wages and employment rates at different education levels? Specifically, how is this effect different for individuals with high school degrees when compared to individuals with bachelor's degrees?</br>
            <br>4. How did the Covid-19 pandemic impact employment rate and wages? And how is this impact furthered by factors such as race and gender?</br>
        </p>
        <div class='my-5'></div>
        <h3>Data Sources</h3>
        <p>We considered and explored data from two different csv files. One included data regarding wages from 1973 to 2022 for different educational attainments, with race and gender included. 
            The second file included data regarding employment rates from 1979 to 2022 for different educational attainments, also including race and gender as variables. In the carousel below,
            snapshots of our csv data files represented in tabular form are displayed. Both data sources contained around 20 factors and almost 50 years worth of data for each of the columns.

        <h3>Data Journey and Caveats</h3>
        <p><h5>Step 1: data acquisition in the form of csv files</h5>
                Caveats: Had difficulty finding a data source that had content adequate for the scope of the project, but were able to eventually ensure
                that our data from the two csv files was accurate, wide in scope, and useful for insights.
   <div class='my-5'></div>
            <h5>Step 2: data parsing, cleaning, and creation of DataFrames in Python</h5>
                Caveats: Encountered difficulty with creating DataFrames from csv data converted to list form. We found that originally, the column names were
                being marked as the first row of data in our DataFrames rather than the column name, which required further adjustment to correct.
    <div class='my-5'></div>
            <h5>Step 3: creating visualizations from DataFrames</h5>
                Caveats: We found that our visualizations were limited by our data and variables, especially we had difficulty with creating animated graphs that
                could accurately display our data in a useable form.
    <div class='my-5'></div>
            <h5>Step 4: website creation using bootstrapr and html code</h5>
                Caveats: Learning and using html coding language in a short period of time proved difficult and required trial and error. Uploading images to our webpage
                also yielded problems, and we opted to insert links to the interactive images while displaying a static image on the main screen as a resolution to this problem.
