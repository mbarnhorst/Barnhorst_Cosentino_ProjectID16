            This visualization focuses on Black, White, and Hispanic wages for those with a bachelor’s degree. We were 
            not surprised by the fact White individuals had a much higher wage than those of color because of systemic 
            racism in our country. We were surprised by the major fluctuations in Black and Hispanic wages; we are not 
            exactly sure why there are such major fluctuations, but the general trend is that they increase over time.</p>

            This visualization displays the differences in the size of the average wage during 1973. We found there 
            was not a significant difference in wage between a less-than-high school education and an advanced degree 
            (only a $20.10 difference). This makes sense because money held a higher value at the time.</p>

        <br>Insights:</br> 
            This visualization displays the differences in the size of the average wage during 2022. In comparison 
            to the 1973 difference, the difference between a less-than-high school education and an advanced degree 
            is very large (a $36.70 difference). This makes sense because of inflation over time and people being 
            rewarded for achieving higher education.</p>

        <h3>Men's Wages by Education Level Overtime</h3>

            <br>Insights:</br> 
            As we expected, the wages for men increase with a higher level of education. We also expected 
            the wages to generally increase over time, and were surprised by how the men with a less than 
            high school education decreased over time; this could be because society began to value education 
            more as time progressed. There was also a large increase in wages around 1985, which could be a 
            time where the economy was thriving.</p>

        <h3>Women's Wages by Education Level Overtime</h3>

            <br>Insights:</br> 
            As expected, the wages for women increase as their level of education increases. There is 
            a very large gap between having some college education, a bachelor's degree, and an advanced 
            degree. This shows that it is beneficial to attain an advanced degree, if possible. There was 
            a pretty decent decrease in wages around the late 1970s and early 1980s; this could be because 
            of stagflation around 1980, where inflation increased and the employment rate decreased.</p>

        <h3>Men vs. Women Wages by Education Level Overtime</h3>

            This visualization shows the disparity between men's and women’s wages in America. In 
            1984, the men with a high school degree and women with a bachelor’s degree finally 
            intersected; from that point on, women with a bachelor’s degree had a higher wage than 
            men with a high school degree. However, there is still a large gap between men's and women’s 
            wages with a bachelor’s degree. In 2022, the average wage for a man with a bachelor’s 
            degree was $49.01 and the average wage for a woman with a bachelor’s degree was $34.39. The 
            visualization also shows that this gap was growing farther apart from 2020 and on.</p>
