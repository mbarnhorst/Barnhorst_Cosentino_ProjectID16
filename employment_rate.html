        <p>This data source is the “Employment-to-Population Ratio” over time in the U.S. The data begins in 1979 and ends 
            in 2022. The data set also provides annual updates. The data is taken from the Economic Policy Institute and 
            the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.</p>

        <h3>Employment Rate by Education Level Overtime</h3>

            <br>Insights:</br> 
            As expected, people with a higher level of education have a higher employment rate. We were surprised 
            by the large gap between those with a less than high school degree and the rest of the education levels. 
            It is interesting to see that the employment rate for those with a bachelor’s degree and an advanced 
            degree are very similar – this shows that having a post-secondary degree in general is the determining 
            factor for high employment.</p>

            This visualization shows the percentage of people employed, distributed by their level of education. 
            The workforce mostly consists of people with a degree, but we were surprised to see how a large 
            percentage of the workforce includes people with less than a college degree. This shows the importance 
            of labor; no matter the education level, people are needed in the workforce.</p>

            <br>Insights:</br> 
            The distribution of employment has stayed relatively the same since 1979, with a minor increase 
            in the number of people with a post-secondary degree; this increase could be due to the increase 
            in white-collar jobs in the workforce. Otherwise, it would make sense that the percentage of 
            employed people increases as the education level increases.</p>

        <h3>Employment Rate of Individuals with Bachelor's Degrees by Race</h3>
        <p>Click <a href="https://mbarnhorst.github.io/Barnhorst_Cosentino_ProjectID16/race_employment_bach_line_viz_embed.html">here</a> to view full interactive visualization!</br>
            <br>Insights:</br> 
            In general we were surprised by this visualization and display of data. Due to a history of 
            systemic racism in America, we expected the employment rates for White individuals to be the highest, 
            but it was actually the opposite; the highest employment rate tends to be Black individuals with a 
            bachelor’s degree, then Hispanic individuals with a bachelor’s degree. We are not certain on the 
            reasoning behind this, but it is an interesting insight. We were also surprised by the major fluctuations 
            over time. There is a lot of variation in employment for different races, and not all peaks and troughs 
            happen during the same time period. </p>

        <h3>Average Employment Rate Overtime</h3>

            <br>Insights:</br> 
            The average employment rate over time shows how the employment rate majorly fluctuates with events 
            in current history. There are major peaks and troughs, displaying times of economic growth and 
            struggle. Specifically, we expected a dramatic decrease around the housing crisis of 2008 and 
            Covid around 2020, which is represented well in the visualization.</p>

            <br>Insights:</br> 
            This graph displays the time frame that could be potentially affected by COVID-19. We wanted to 
            see if men or women took more of a dramatic hit due to the pandemic, but both genders tended to 
            decrease at a similar rate. The employment rates for men and women with a high school degree 
            both decreased more than those with a bachelor’s degree.</p>

            <br>Insights:</br> 
            In this visualization, we emphasized the differences between the employment rate of race and 
            level of education during the pandemic. Most of the demographics decreased at the same rate, 
            but there was a larger decrease for Hispanic individuals with a high school degree and Black 
            individuals with a high school degree. We were surprised to see that Black individuals with 
            a high school degree dropped below the employment rate of White individuals with a high school 
            degree during the pandemic.</p>
